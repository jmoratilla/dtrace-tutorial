# Top three questions to answer : 
# 1- What are the applications running in this environment 
# and their main characteristics ?
# 2- What are the main data streams and what transport mechanism 
# are used (tcp, udp ...) ? 
# 3- Most importantly, what is running that we do not know about ? 
# A way to detect this is to run this simple DTrace audit script :
# (Note that this script is Solaris 10 zone aware... ) 


/usr/sbin/dtrace -n 'proc:::exec{printf("%s execing %s, , uid/zone = %d/%s\\n",execname,args[0],uid,zonename)}'
